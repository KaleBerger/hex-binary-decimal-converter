There is not a whole lot difference between how my program runs and how it would run if it was procedural. The only difference between my program and procedural, is that if it was procedural, I wouldn't have to define a class and put the loop as a function within the class. Since my object oriented programming does not use pygame, the only change I would have to make is remove the "Class" part of the code.
